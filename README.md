# Shopify Store Information and Contact Form Automator

Shopify Contact Form Automator is a time-saving Python automation tool for e-commerce business owners or anyone who needs to contact Shopify stores en masse. It navigates through a list of Shopify stores, extracts their information, locates their contact forms, and loads the pages one by one for you. This automation leaves you with just the task of submitting the forms or completing the captcha. A beeping sound  plays every time manual input is required.

## Features
# Automated Shopify Store Information Extraction
The script navigates to a list of Shopify stores using this website to find all stores hosted by Shopify: https://myip.ms). It extracts the URLs of the Shopify stores and writes them to a CSV file.

# Contact Form Detection
The second script navigates to each Shopify store, locates the contact page, and fills out the contact form with predefined data.

# Resilience to CAPTCHA and Errors
Both scripts are resilient to CAPTCHAs and page load errors. If a CAPTCHA is detected, a sound will be played, and the script will wait for the user to manually complete the CAPTCHA.

## Usage
In script1.py, specify the range of pages to scrape from https://myip.ms/browse/sites/1/ownerID/376714/ownerIDii/ in the line for page_number .

Run script1.py. The script will navigate to each page of a Shopify store list website, attempt to locate a table of Shopify store URLs, and save these URLs to a csv.

Run script2.py. The script will read the URLs from the csv, navigate to each Shopify store's contact page, and attempt to fill the contact form with predefined data.

Note: During both scripts, if a CAPTCHA or an error is encountered, a beep sound will be played and the script will pause until you manually resolve the issue and press the "Continue to next website" button.
